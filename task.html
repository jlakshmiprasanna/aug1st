        <h3>About</h3>
        <p><i>Vegetarians don’t eat meat for a range of health, environmental, ethical, religious or economic reasons.
                There are many different types of vegetarianism.
                A well-planned vegetarian diet can meet nutritional needs during all stages of life.Some nutrients, such
                as protein, iron, calcium, zinc, vitamin B12 and vitamin D can be harder to obtain from some types of
                vegetarian diets.
                Special care needs to be taken during pregnancy, breastfeeding and with children on vegetarian and,
                especially, vegan diets.</i></p>
        <div id="Description">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><i>A vegetarian diet is one that does not include any meat or seafood. However, there are many variations
                    to this – some people following a vegetarian diet may eat eggs and dairy foods, while others may
                    avoid one or both.

                    A vegan diet is another form of vegetarianism where only plant foods are eaten and all foods from
                    animal sources are avoided (meat, seafood, dairy, eggs and sometimes honey and gelatine).

                    Vegetarian diets can have many health benefits. They can offer all the essential vitamins and
                    minerals necessary for a long and healthy life provided they are well-planned.

                    People who are breastfeeding and children who have a vegetarian diet need to take particular care to
                    make sure they get all the essential nutrients they need for healthy growth and development.</i></p>

                <h3>Pulihora</h3>1. To make mustard powder (optional) - Add mustard seeds to a pan and heat them. Do not
                roast a lot they may turn bitter. Remove and set aside to cool. or you can also use sesame seeds. Dry
                roast them in a pan until they begin to splutter. Turn off and cool them. Make a fine powder. Keep this
                aside.
                2. Soaking Tamarind: Rinse and soak tamarind in hot water and make a thick paste by squeezing. Filter to
                remove stones and debris. Set this aside.
                3. Cook rice without making it mushy, I cook rice in a pressure cooker directly for 1 whistle. Spread
                the rice on a wide plate and sprinkle salt, turmeric and oil. Set aside to cool completely.
                4. Add oil to a pan and heat it. Next add mustard, chana dal, urad dal and peanuts. Fry the peanuts till
                golden & aromatic. Then add curry leaves, ginger, green chilies and red chilies. Fry everything well
                until the curry leaves turn crisp
                5. Add tamarind paste, jaggery, hing and more salt.Cook until the mixture becomes thick.
                6. Switch off the stove when the mixture begins to leave oil on the sides.
                7. Sprinkle mustard powder. Then add the pulihora mixture over it. Mix the rice well. Taste test
                and adjust salt.
            </li>

                <h3>Tomato pappu</h3>1. To make tomato dal you can cook the dal directly in a pressure cooker or cook
                pot- in-pot in the cooker. If you do not have a cooker you can make this in a sauce pot following my
                recipe instructions in the recipe card below. If you own a Instant pot, you can cook this in the Instant
                pot too following the same method.
                2. Add 1/2 cup dal to a bowl or cooker or pot. If you want you may add 2 tablespoons of moong dal too &
                add more water as required.
                3. Rinse the dal at least thrice until the water runs clear. Drain the water
                4. Add 1 to 2 green chilies and a small piece of cleaned tamarind. If you want you can also rinse
                the tamarind first.
                5. Next add 2 chopped tomatoes. I prefer to deseed the tomatoes. Pour 1 cup water and ½ teaspoon
                turmeric. You can also add turmeric later after cooking. A lot of people also add a sliced onion and
                some red chilli powder. If you want you may add a small sliced onion and 1/4 tsp red chilli powder.
                6. Pour water in your cooker. I use about 1½ cups water. Place the steam rack or plate.
                7. Keep the bowl in the cooker.
                8.Cover the bowl. If you want you can also cook the rice together if you have a large cooker. For this
                add your rice to another bowl. Rinse well, drain and pour the required amount of water and keep in the
                cooker, over the dal bowl.
                9.Pressure cook for 3 to 5 whistles on a medium heat depending on the kind of cooker. If cooking
                directly in cooker, then let it whistle twice. If using a Instant pot, set the timer to 10 mins.
                10. When the pressure drops open the lid. Dal and tomatoes have to be soft cooked. If you have kids, you
                can set their portion aside before mashing the chilies and tempering. I usually do it for my younger
                boy.
                11. Mash and check the consistency. If it is too thick for your liking, pour little hot water & mix to
                adjust the consistency.
                12. Add 1 teaspoon salt and mix. Taste test and adjust salt.
                Temper Tomato Dal
                13. Poppu or Tempering can be done in 2 ways. First method is to temper in a small pan and pour it to
                the cooked dal. The second method is to pour the entire cooked dal to the tempering pan. This method
                doubles the taste and flavor of tomato pappu. Heat 1 tablespoon ghee or oil in a pan. Add ½ teaspoon
                mustard, 1½ teaspoon cumin seeds and 1 dried red chili 
                14. Quickly mix it with ghee.
                15. Pour the tomato dal to the pan.
                16. Turn off the stove and mix well. If you cook longer at this stage the dal begins to splatter.

                <h3>Potato Fry</h3>Rinse the potatoes in fresh water. Then peel and chop potatoes in 2 cm cubes or 1
                inch cubes. Ensure that the potatoes are chopped in almost the same size so that they cook evenly.

                Place them in a bowl of water for 20 to 30 minutes. The potatoes should be completely immersed in the
                water.

                Soaking potatoes in water helps to get rid of some of the starch. But if you have less time on hand then
                you can skip this step.

                Note: There are many varieties of potatoes that will work nicely in this recipe. Regular Indian
                potatoes, baby potatoes, red skinned potatoes, Yukon gold (yellow potatoes), and russet potatoes are all
                suitable option for this dish.
                Heat a heavy thick bottomed pan or cast iron skillet or a heavy kadai. Add 2 tablespoons oil. For a
                slight pungent taste you can use mustard oil. I have used peanut oil. If using mustard oil, then heat
                till the mustard oil starts smoking.
                Heat a heavy thick bottomed pan or cast iron skillet or a heavy kadai. Add 2 tablespoons oil. For a

                till the mustard oil starts smoking.
                Mix them very well with the oil and spread them evenly in the pan. Keep on stirring after a few minutes
                and overall saute for 7 to 8 minutes, till the potatoes are half cooked on a low to medium-low flame.
                Then add the following spices:

                ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)
                ½ teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder (or paprika)
                ½ teaspoon coriander powder (ground coriander)
                ½ teaspoon cumin powder (ground cumin)
                a pinch of asafoetida (optional)
                salt as per taste.
                Mix the ground spice powders very well with the potatoesMix very well and then switch off the heat
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Vankay</h3>1. Dry roast 4 to 6 dried red chilies (as per your preference) and 1/4 cup peanuts on a
                medium flame until the peanuts turn aromatic and deep golden. If your chilies begin to brown/burn too
                soon, remove them and keep aside. Tip: You can also use red chili powder or flakes if you don't have
                chilies. Add directly to the grinder while grinding, you don't need to toast.
                2. Lower the flame completely. Add the following spices and toast until aromatic.

                • 1 tablespoon coriander seeds

                • ½ teaspoon cumin seeds

                • 1 inch cinnamon piece

                • 2 to 3 cloves

                • 2 green cardamoms
                3.Add 2 tablespoons grated or chopped coconut. Saute until aromatic, for 2 to 3 mins. Do not burn.
                4. Cool them and add to a grinder with 1½ teaspoon salt and 1½ tablespoons lemon juice or tamarind paste
                (or 1 tsp concentrate).
                5. Grind as fine as possible. Slightly coarse powder is alright. Taste test and adjust salt or lemon to
                your preference. If your peanut masala lacks flavor, add some garam masala if you want. To up the heat
                level, you may add some chili powder.
                6. Wash 4 to 6 brinjals under running water and slit them diagonally with the stalks intact. Check the
                picture below. Add them to a bowl of water with half teaspoon salt. This prevents discoloration and also
                hydrates the eggplants from inside. Stuff each brinjal with as much ground masala as possible.
                <h4>Make the Curry</h4>
                7. Heat a pan with 2 tablespoons oil. Add 1½ teaspoon mustard seeds, 1½ teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 sprig
                curry leaves and a pinch of hing (optional). (Pat dry the curry leaves before adding to
                avoid splatters.)
                8. When the seeds splutter and the curry leaves turn crisp, add ½ cup chopped or sliced onions and 1
                slit green chili. Saute until they turn light golden or transparent
                9. Add 1 teaspoon ginger garlic paste (or use ³¼ teaspoon grated ginger & ³¼ teaspoon pressed garlic).
                Saute for a minute, until aromatic
                10. This step is optional. You can also omit tomatoes. Add 1 small tomato (about ½ cup chopped), ½
                teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon turmeric. You can also add a bit of chili powder if you want.
                11. Saute until the tomatoes turn mushy and blend well with onions.
                12. Add the stuffed brinjals. Saute them well for 2 to 3 mins.
                13. Add cup water and the remaining peanut masala if any.
                14. Bring to a rolling boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook covered until the eggplants are
                completely tender and cooked. Add more water as you cook if the pan dries out. Some of the stuffing will
                pop out and thicken the curry as you cook.
                15. When done, brinjals wilt completely and the skin loosens. A good way to test is to pierce a knife
                deep inside, near the stalk. If it goes in easily without any resistance the eggplants are cooked. Taste
                test and adjust salt or lemon juice. Garnish with coriander leaves.

                <h3>Bendakay fry</h3>1. Rinse and wipe dry 250 grams bendakaya (okra or bhindi) with a clean kitchen
                towel. Then slice the bendakaya into rounds of 0.5 to 0.75 inches. Keep aside.
                Before chopping make sure that there is no water or moisture on the okra pods. They should be thoroughly
                dried. Also the okra should be green and tender.
                250 grams bendakaya gives about 2 heaped cups of chopped bendakaya.2. in a shallow frying pan, heat 2
                tablespoons of oil. Lower the heat and add the following ingredients:
                ½ teaspoon mustard seeds
                ½ teaspoon cumin seeds
                ½ teaspoon urad dal (split and husked black gram).3. Saute till the mustard seeds crackle and the urad
                dal turns golden.4. Next add 2 dry red chilies (broken and deseeded). Saute for a second or two till the
                red chilies change color. Instead of red chilies you can also add slit or chopped 1 to 2 green chilies.
                5. Then add ½ cup chopped onion.6. Stir and mix well.7.Saute the onions till they turn translucent
                stirring often on low heat.
